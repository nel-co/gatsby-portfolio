### The Overview

[MineWorthy](https://enigmatic-peak-56673.herokuapp.com/) is a full stack web app that I designed/built using MongoDB, Express.js, EJS templates, and Node. The main goal of the app is to allow users to sign up and save the coordinates of cool and interesting things they find in their Minecraft world.
