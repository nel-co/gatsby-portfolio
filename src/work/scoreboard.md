### The Overview

[Discgolfscoreboard.com](Discgolfscoreboard.com) is a web app that I designed and coded. The goal was to create a clean and straight forward user interface that was easy to use. The competitors for this app all try to do to much, that's why with this app I focused on just the basic needs of the disc golfer. It allows users to add new courses/players, keep track of their scores, manage their bags, and measure the distance of the throw.

### The Process

My idea for the UI in regards to switching to the next hole is a swipeable card. The cards appear stacked on top of each other so that the user experiences a progression while playing through the round. When you're out on the course in the middle of the day, users should be able to just pull your phone out and enter the score. That's why I chose high contrasting colors so that it's easier see in the sunlight.

User testing for this was really fun! (I mean who doesn't love disc golf, right?) I would go to local courses and show people playing the app and ask if they would use it for a round so I can get some feedback. I would give them tasks of what to complete and watch them do it. I learned a lot by doing this and implemented new features based on the user interviews. (Features like the note screen, my bag, and disabling buttons if they're not meant to be clicked yet.) Even though I'm still iterating and updating (always!), I'm happy with where it's at now.
