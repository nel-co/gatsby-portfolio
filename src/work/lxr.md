### The Overview

[LXRWash.com](https://lxrwash.com) is an ecommerce site that sells a patented auto wash for your vehicle. With this site, I refactored a lot of the front end code to perform better on mobile and increase page load speed, restyled multiple components throughout the site (footer, cart, and testimonials), integrated a MailChimp email newsletter subscription form, added a blog onto the site so the client can post articles,designed/coded product landing pages for ad campaigns, and ran A/B tests. Although it's still early, the updates look promising as sales have been up ever since they've been implemented.
