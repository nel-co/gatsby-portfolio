### The Overview

[iheartdogs.com](https://iheartdogs.com/coffee) is a pet store that makes unique products for pets that support animal shelters and rescue organizations. I worked with their team to collaborate on landing page designs and front-end coding. Once the designs were finalized, I coded the pages from scratch to be fully responsive and light weight. I created reusable CSS so that we'll be able to quickly and easily create more landing pages based off of the templates.

### The Results
