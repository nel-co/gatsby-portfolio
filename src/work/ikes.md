### The Overview

[Ikes Korner Grill](http://ikes.x10host.com/) is a top local burger place that was really in need of a site redesign. I built it from scratch using HTML/SASS/Javascript and Wordpress. With the site, the main need for it was a place to see their menu, hours, and phone number. At the top bar, I've got it set up to dynamically show the hours they're open based on whenever you're viewing the site. Both the hours and phone number are prominently displayed for both mobile and desktop users.

The menu is set up with [Advanced custom fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) in the backend to allow the client to easily update menu items and prices.
