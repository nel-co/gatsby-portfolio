[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) is a free text-editor developed by Microsoft that works really well with Javascript projects. I've been using VSCode for maybe a year, and after using Brackets, Atom, and Sublime Text it quickly became my goto text-editor. Like most text-editors, it can be extended with plug-ins to help you out and become more efficient.

Here's my list of favorite plug-ins for front-end development.

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify" target="_blank"><h3>Beautify</h3></a>
Beautify and indent your code for you.

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer" target="_blank"><h3>Bracket Pair Colorizer</h3></a>
Colorizes the code brackets so that it's easier to tell what scope you're in.

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint" target="_blank"><h3>ESLint</h3></a>
Integrates ESLint into VSCode so that you're writing better code.

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles" target="_blank"><h3>Markdown Preview Github Styling</h3></a>
Lets you preview .md files right inside of VSCode.

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager" target="_blank"><h3>Project Manager</h3></a>
Comes in handy if you work on multiple projects at a time. It lets you easily access the projects and switch between them.

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets" target="_blank"><h3>ES7 React/JS Snippets</h3></a>
Provides you with tons of snippets to use to code quicker. For example, ```imrc``` becomes ```import React, { Component } from 'react'```

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shidhincr.theme-dracula-italics" target="_blank"><h3>Dracula Theme with Italic Keywords</h3></a>
Not an extension, but my current favorite theme. A dark theme that uses italics on keywords.
